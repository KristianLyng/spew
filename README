Installation and usage
======================

Dependencies: 
	
- C compiler
- make
- awk
- basic build stuff
- Linux (because of epoll)

From a repo: ./autogensh && ./configure && make && make install
From a tar-ball: ./configure && make && make install

Running: spew --help

If it's not in --help, it's not in spew. If it is, then someone got drunk,
wohoo!

See WIP (Work In Progress) for day-to-day changes. The content of WIP as it
was upon compile-time is usually printed upon startup.

History
=======

The core part of spew, src/http.c, was hacked together in about 10 hours
total by Kristian Lyngst√∏l for Varnish Software.

Everything else was then later borrowed from an old defunct project I had
that only did parameter-parsin, config file support and all the typical
boring stuff. That's why http.c and the rest is pretty different.
If you find references to X-related stuff, let me know. They are old.
